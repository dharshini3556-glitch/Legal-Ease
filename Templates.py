"""
prompts.py
-----------
Prompt templates used to instruct the Generative AI model (Google Gemini)
to produce structured, clause-by-clause legal document content.
 
Each function returns a single prompt string built from user-supplied
fields. The model is instructed to return clean, section-labelled text
so the downstream document builder (doc_generator.py) can format it
consistently into PDF / DOCX / TXT.
